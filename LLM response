Prompt:Analyze the last part of this novel

Response: In the final chapters of "The Great Gatsby," F. Scott Fitzgerald deepens the exploration of central themes such as the contrast between appearance and reality, along with social hierarchy. The narrative reaches a pivotal moment with Myrtle Wilson's tragic end, where Tom Buchanan attempts to exert control over his life but ultimately reveals the societal obsession with superficial respectability over true morality through actions like giving Myrtle a car to hide his affair with Daisy.

Fitzgerald uses symbols such as Doctor T.J. Eckleburg’s eyes to critique a society driven by materialism and ethical decay. The oppressive heat throughout the novel mirrors Gatsby's internal struggles, foreshadowing disaster. Cars symbolize both freedom and confinement, reflecting Tom's desperate attempts to escape reality.

Through Nick Carraway's narrative lens, readers navigate a complex moral landscape where characters confront personal dilemmas. A sense of impending doom surrounds Tom’s unraveling life during the Roaring Twenties—a period marked by economic boom and cultural change.

Fitzgerald employs vivid imagery and potent symbolism in crafting an ending that underscores human folly and desire, capturing a widespread disillusionment with societal values.
