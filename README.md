# Hi there, I'm @SaiYi98! 👋

I'm a data and research analyst at a tech think-tank in DC, diving into quantitative research on innovation policy. Previously, I worked as a data analyst in the financial and consulting industries. You'll often find me working with Python, SQL, and (now mostly) Tableau.

## A bit about me:
- 👀 **Interests:** I love digging into data and bringing stories to life with EDA, ML modeling, and visualizations.
  
- 📒 **Work:** I conduct quantitative research and put together analysis reports for my supervisors, clients, and stakeholders.
  
- 🌱 **Learning:** Currently having fun exploring High-Frequency Trading and Cryptography, always dreaming about pursuing a PhD.
  
- 🔒 **Projects:** I'm thinking about posting some of my current and past projects here. Just can't share most of what I'm working on right now due to confidentiality.
  
- 📫 **Contact:** Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:cyzhang1125@outlook.com) if you have any questions or just want to connect.

## P.S.
I recently welcomed a two-month-old Golden Retriever puppy at home. He says hi! 🐶
